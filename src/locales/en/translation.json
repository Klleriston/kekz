    "description": "Fullstack Systems Developer (Backend & Frontend) with 3+ years of experience in development, maintenance, and analysis of scalable, high-performance applications. I worked in partnership with Google creating solutions for major educational institutions (SENAI, SESI, CNI), including a search tool with 30kâ€“50k monthly users, expanding user base engagement. I participated in developing an interactive platform with infinite feed for internal collaboration, used by companies like Wizard and Mercado Livre, contributing to +70% productivity improvement through gamified features. In the banking sector, I worked at BTG Pactual, providing support and maintenance for internal systems (WM), integration analysis, and end-to-end sustenance. Passionate about technical challenges, I work from concept to delivery in dynamic, highly complex environments, always focused on robust solutions with real impact.",
